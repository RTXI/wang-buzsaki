###Wang-Buzsaki Model Neuron

**Requirements:** None
**Limitations:** None

The Wang-Buzsaki model uses the Hodgkin-Huxley formalism to describe a single-compartment neuron with sodium and potassium conductances. For the transient sodium current, the activation variable m is assumed fast and substituted by its steady-state function.
